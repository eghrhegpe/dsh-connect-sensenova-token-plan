/**
 * The shared polling loop: one interval, paused while the tab is hidden, with
 * an error back-off.
 *
 * Why this module exists: the quota tab and the Raccoon tab each grew their own
 * copy of "set an interval, run `load`, clear it on unmount", and then they
 * drifted in exactly the way duplicated logic always does — the quota copy
 * learned to stop while `document.visibilityState === "hidden"`, the Raccoon
 * copy never did. A user who left the Raccoon tab open in a background window
 * kept it hammering `/api/<ns>/raccoon` every 60 s (every 2 s mid-scan) while
 * the quota tab beside it had gone quiet, and README's "polling stops when the
 * panel is closed" was only true of one of the two. Neither loop had a back-off
 * either: while the Host was down both retried at full cadence until the panel
 * closed. This module is the one definition, so the next tab inherits both
 * behaviours instead of re-deciding them.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does NOT own: the request itself (each tab has its
 * own generation guard and AbortController) and the "should I even poll" answer
 * (the Raccoon tab must not poll before it is switched on). The caller passes
 * `enabled` and a stable `run`.
 *
 * @module dsh-connect-sensenova-token-plan/use-polling-interval

/**
 * How long to wait after a failure before trying again.
 *
 * The Host owns the healthy cadence; it does not own this one, because it never
 * sees the failure — a panel whose Host is down is exactly the case where there
 * is no answer to state a cadence in. 60 s is the same floor the Raccoon poll
 * already used in its healthy state, so a failure never polls FASTER than the
 * steady state it is backing off from.
