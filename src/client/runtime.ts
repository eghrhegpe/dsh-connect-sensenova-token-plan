/**
 * The React seam.
 *
 * The loader materializes `clientFactory(loaderRequire)` with the browser
 * module table's own React — the client never imports a React package, and
 * the Node suites hand the factory a recording stand-in instead. Every other
 * module reads React through here: `provideClientReact` runs once at factory
 * entry, and the forwarded `h`/hooks below resolve through it at render time.
 *
 * Call sites stay identical to the pre-split closure form (`h("div", ...)`,
 * `useState(...)`), so the components are transcriptions, not rewrites.
 *
 * The factory parameter is named `loaderRequire` — NOT `require` — on purpose:
 * a bare `require("react")` in bundled ESM is module-system syntax as far as a
 * bundler is concerned (it may rewrite or resolve it); any other identifier is
 * verifiably a plain parameter call and survives the bundle untouched.
