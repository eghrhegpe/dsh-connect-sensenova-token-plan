/**
 * One coalescing read-through cache: a TTL cache plus ONE in-flight promise

 *
 * Two properties every caller needs, and that are easy to get wrong when each
 * fetch re-implements them by hand (as `console-client.ts` once did twice):
 *
 *   1. **Single flight** — N concurrent readers of one key share ONE upstream
 *      call. Without it, every open panel (or tab) polling at once issues its
 *      own request, which is how a Host walks into the platform's own rate
 *      limiter.
 *   2. **Read-through TTL** — a fresh answer is served from memory; a stale one
 *      is refetched.
 *
 * A REJECTED producer is shared but never cached: a failure is not an answer,
 * and caching one would pin an error on the panel for a whole TTL after a
 * single transient hiccup. Sharing the rejection is still correct — the callers
 * asked for the same thing at the same time and get the same outcome.
 *
 * The maps are injectable so a caller can share one cache across modules (the
 * console route's `cache`/`inflight` pair is created in `index.ts` and cleared
 * wholesale when the account or key changes).
 *
 * @module dsh-connect-sensenova-token-plan/coalesced-fetch

 * request while injecting one long-lived shared map (which is exactly what
 * `console-client.ts` does, over the `cache`/`inflight` pair created in
 * `index.ts`). Per-instance counters would reset to 0 on every call, so a
 * `clear()` bump would be invisible to the very next read and a pre-clear
 * flight's answer would be served to the account that just signed in.
 * Hanging the counters off the map makes every instance over that map share
 * one generation state, so the guard holds no matter how the caller builds it.
