/**
 * The single adjudicator for "panel-saved value vs config default" across
 * every opt-in switch.
 *
 * Historically the rule was hand-copied at three call sites (the provider
 * route, the models route, the draw route) in two look-alike dialects:
 *
 *   - the boolean switch: `(panel ?? config) === true` plus
 *     `panel === null ? "config" : "panel"`;
 *   - the model preference: `panel ?? config` plus the same source probe.
 *
 * A fourth dialect existed where no config default exists at all (the Raccoon
 * switch — a profile without a saved value falls to `off` with no fallback),
 * which is exactly the shape this module does NOT serve: that one has no
 * config default to adjudicate against, so it is the caller's plain read.
 *
 * This module is peer-free and deliberately tiny: the whole point is that a
 * switch can never again invent its own precedence dialect, and the source
 * label (`panel` / `config`) always rides with the answer so the panel can
 * say which side is in charge. `test/switch-precedence.test.mjs` pins the
 * dialect so a new caller copying the shape is the odd one out.
