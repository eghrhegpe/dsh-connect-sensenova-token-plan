/**
 * The provider-registration switch — this plugin's OWN state file, never the
 * Host's configuration.
 *
 * Why a file at all: `registerProvider` in `cordis.patch.yml` is a DEPLOYMENT
 * default the operator edits with a reload, but the panel needs a live switch
 * that takes effect on the next request. The switch state therefore lives in
 * `$DSH_HOME/state/<plugin>/provider.json`, exactly like the catalog
 * (`catalog-store.ts`) and the throttle (`throttle-store.ts`): operational
 * state, not an operator decision baked into the patch layer.
 *
 * Precedence at read time:
 *
 *   1. a value SAVED FROM THE PANEL (enabled: true|false) always wins;
 *   2. no saved value (never touched, or the file was unreadable) falls back
 *      to the patch's `registerProvider` — so an operator who enabled the
 *      provider through configuration keeps it enabled across this change.
 *
 * Integrity follows `throttle-store.ts` / `catalog-store.ts`: a versioned
 * payload, a temp file plus an atomic rename (two Host processes can share
 * the directory), owner-only modes, and "anything unrecognised reads as not
 * set" — a corrupted or downgraded file costs one re-toggle, never a crash.
