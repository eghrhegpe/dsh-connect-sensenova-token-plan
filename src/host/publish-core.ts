/**
 * The shared bones of a provider publisher — the parts that MUST NOT differ
 * between upstreams, factored out so they cannot drift.
 *
 * Both publishers (`provider-publish.ts` for the Token Plan provider,
 * `raccoon-publish.ts` for the Raccoon one) run the same control plane: a
 * publish queue, a `disposed` gate, and a single-point pair registration that
 * doubles as the rollback path. Those three are load-bearing and pinned by
 * tests (PITFALLS §18 for the queue, §19 for the register shape) — and the
 * rollback is the worst place to discover a divergence, because it only runs
 * once something has already failed. When they were written twice, keeping
 * them in sync relied on comments in one file pointing at the other; here
 * there is one copy.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT shared: the publish GATE and the state shape. The
 * Token Plan side decides from "switch on?" plus a persisted catalog and an
 * allow-list, and restores `entries`/`enabledIds`/quota ids on a rollback; the
 * Raccoon side decides from "switch on?" plus "is there a credential?" and
 * restores its roster. That difference is real domain difference, and folding
 * it into one parameterized state machine would make a publish unreadable —
 * every reader would have to read the configuration to know what one does.
 *
 * Peer-free: touches no runtime peer.
